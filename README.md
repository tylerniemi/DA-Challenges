# Challenge 1

Use object-oriented Ruby to model a public library (w/ three classes: Library, Shelf, & Book). *
The library should be aware of a number of distinct shelves. Each shelf should know what books it contains. Create methods to add and remove a book from a self. The library should have a method to report all books it contains. Note: this should *not* be a Rails app - just a single file with three classes (plus commands at the bottom showing it works) is all that is needed. In addition to pushing this ruby file to your Github account, please also setup your code at http://repl.it/languages/Ruby (so it runs).

#Challenge 2

Make a simple html page to manage Todos. *
It should have an input field. When the user enters text in the input field, add that input to the top of the Todo list. When an existing item is clicked, it should disappear from the page. In addition to pushing the answer to your Github account, please also setup a http://jsfiddle.net/ with the solution (so it runs correctly).
